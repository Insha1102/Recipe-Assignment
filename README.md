# Recipe-Assignment
This is final version of recipe assignment.
I have developed an application for Recipe Handling with REST APIs to interact with data using Spring boot framework.
For developing this application I have used various frameworks :
SPRING BOOT: 
Spring boot is used to create a stand alone spring based application that can be started using java-jar.
Features:
1.)Embedded tomcat,jetty or undertow directly.There is no need to deploy WAR files.
2.)It provides starter POM files to simplify maven configuration.
3.)In Spring Boot, everything is auto configured; no manual configurations are needed
4.)No code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.
5.)Reduces the development time and run the application independently.

HIBERNATE:
Hibernate is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language.
It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.
Hibernate's primary feature is mapping from Java classes to database tables, and mapping from Java data types to SQL data types. 
Hibernate also provides data query and retrieval facilities.
It generates SQL calls and relieves the developer from the manual handling and object conversion of the result set.

H2 DATABASE:
The main features of H2 are:
1.)Very fast, open source, JDBC API
2.)Embedded and server modes; in-memory databases
3.)Browser based Console application
4.)Small footprint: around 2 MB jar file size

JUNIT:
JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language.
I have written 6 test cases for the service class and 1 for the controller class.
Due to time constraints other test cases are not present.

And in the Front End I have used basic html css javascript and jquery.
jQuery is a JavaScript Library.It greatly simplifies JavaScript programming.It is easy to learn.
